# DOTA - Over-the-Air Updates for React Native Apps

DOTA empowers React Native developers to deliver over-the-air (OTA) updates directly to user devices, bypassing app store delays and enabling rapid iteration. DOTA is a self-hostable OTA update server that can be deployed locally or on any cloud provider, giving you full control over your update pipeline and user data.

## üöÄ Quickstart (Self-Host in Minutes!)

Get up and running with your own DOTA server in just a few steps. **Clone, run, and launch your own over-the-air update service‚Äîno cloud lock-in, no complex setup!**

### 1. Clone the repository (HTTP or SSH)
```bash
# Using HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/dream-sports-labs/dota.git
# Or using SSH
git clone git@github.com:dream-sports-labs/dota.git
cd dota
```

### 2. Run the setup script
```bash
./launchdota.sh
```

That's it! The script will:
- Set up all dependencies
- Configure your environment
- Start the API and Web Dashboard
- Log you in with a mock or real Google token
- Open the dashboard in your browser

**How crazy is that?** With just two commands, you get a full, production-ready, self-hostable OTA update solution‚Äîno vendor lock-in, no hidden steps. Use DOTA as your own private CodePush server, on your terms.

> **Unique Selling Point:** DOTA is the only open-source solution that lets you go from zero to a fully working OTA update server in minutes, with a single script. Perfect for teams, enterprises, and indie devs who want control, privacy, and speed.

## üöÄ Overview

DOTA provides a complete solution for React Native over-the-air updates, allowing you to:

- Deploy app updates without going through app stores
- Target updates to specific app versions

## üì¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Docker Desktop (must be running)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Google OAuth configuration (optional)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dream-sports-labs/dota
```

2. Create environment files:
```bash
./env.dev.sh
```
This script copies `env.web.dev` from the root directory into `.env` files in both `api` and `web` directories.

3. Navigate to the API directory:
```bash
cd api
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev:web
```

After successful installation, you should see:
- Server running at `http://localhost:3010`
- CLI logged in (verify with `dota --version` and `dota whoami`)
- Web server running at `http://localhost:3000`

## ü§ù Contribute to DOTA

DOTA is an open-source project and welcomes contributions from the community. For details on how to contribute, please see our [guide to contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### DOTA Server

The DOTA Server is a deployable artifact that can be run locally or on any cloud provider. It enables you to self-host your own OTA update service for React Native apps, with quick local launch and full cloud configurability. You can use DOTA as a base component to spawn a self-hosted server, or integrate it into your existing infrastructure.

- **Local Deployment:** Launch instantly for development or testing.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Configure for AWS, Azure, or your preferred provider.

See [Quick Setup](#quick-setup) and [API documentation](./api/README.md) for details.

### Local Deployment

Run DOTA Server on your own infrastructure for development or production.  
See [API documentation](./api/README.md) for prerequisites and setup steps.

### DOTA CLI

The DOTA CLI, located in the `cli` subdirectory, is a command-line tool that allows developers to interact with the DOTA server. For detailed information about the DOTA CLI, including installation instructions and usage details, please refer to the [DOTA CLI README](./cli/README.md).

### DOTA Web

The DOTA Web Dashboard, located in the `web` subdirectory, is a web-based management interface that provides a user-friendly way to manage your deployments, monitor metrics, and configure your DOTA environment. For detailed information about the DOTA Web Dashboard, including installation instructions and usage details, please refer to the [DOTA Web README](./web/README.md).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Node.js (>=18.0.0)
- TypeScript
- React (Web Dashboard)
- Docker (for containerization)

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Options

### Local Deployment

For development or self-hosted environments, DOTA can be run locally. The server requires storage support (Azure Blob Storage or Azurite emulator locally).

### AWS Deployment

To deploy on AWS:
1. Set up IAM roles and permissions.
2. Configure S3 for storage.
3. Set environment variables in `.env` for AWS credentials and S3 bucket.
4. Follow [AWS Setup Guide](./documentation/src/pages/documentation/deployment/aws.jsx) for step-by-step instructions.

### Azure Deployment

DOTA is designed to run as an Azure App Service with Azure Blob Storage for backend storage needs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values for your environment.  
See [Environment Setup Guide](./api/ENVIRONMENT.md) for details.

> **Note:** DOTA supports Google OAuth and mock token login for development. Microsoft and GitHub OAuth are not required.

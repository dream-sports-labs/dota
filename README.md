# DOTA - Over-the-Air Updates for React Native Apps

DOTA enables React Native developers to deploy mobile app updates directly to their users' devices. It consists of two parts: DOTA Server where developers publish app updates (JS, HTML, CSS or image changes), and [DOTA React Native Client SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push) that enables querying for updates from within an app.

## üöÄ Overview

DOTA provides a complete solution for React Native over-the-air updates, allowing you to:

- Deploy app updates without going through app stores
- Target updates to specific app versions
- Control the rollout percentage of updates
- Make updates mandatory when critical
- Monitor deployment metrics
- Manage multiple deployment environments (Staging, Production)

## üì¶ Getting Started

### DOTA Server

The DOTA server, located in the `api` subdirectory, allows you to build, deploy and manage DOTA updates yourself. You can deploy the server in multiple ways:

- **AWS** - Deploy to your own AWS infrastructure
- **Azure** - Run as an Azure App Service
- **Local** - Run on your own servers or development environment

For detailed information about the DOTA server, including installation instructions and usage details, please refer to the [DOTA Server README](./api/README.md).

### DOTA CLI

The DOTA CLI, located in the `cli` subdirectory, is a command-line tool that allows developers to interact with the DOTA server. For detailed information about the DOTA CLI, including installation instructions and usage details, please refer to the [DOTA CLI README](./cli/README.md).

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Options

### Local Deployment

For development or self-hosted environments, DOTA can be run locally. The server requires storage support (Azure Blob Storage or Azurite emulator locally).

### AWS Deployment

DOTA can be deployed to AWS using your preferred AWS services for computing and storage(docker emulator locally).

### Azure Deployment

DOTA is designed to run as an Azure App Service with Azure Blob Storage for backend storage needs.
